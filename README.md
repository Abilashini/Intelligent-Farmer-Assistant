"# Intelligent-Farmer-Assistant" 

It is a IoT project done for the module Industrial Computer Engineering Project in Semester 6. 

'Intelligent Farmer Assistant' is a system which detects the pH amount in the soil and calculate the requirement of nutrition for the plant. It notify the farmer throgh a sms. 

Arduino has been used in this project. Here you can find the arduino program. 

A pH probe has been used to find out the pH value in the soil. Using the voltage difference gained from the pH prope, the program find out the ph value. There will be a pH range for each fertilizer. According to that, the system decides on which fertilizer is needed to be feed to the plant and notify the farmer. The notification part has been done using GPRS module.
